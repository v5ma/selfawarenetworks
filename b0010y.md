# OpenAI Whisper Transcription + Title's from Self Aware Networks GPT:

## 1: Rate Coding and Synaptic Transmission in Neurons
Okay, so essentially the rate coding with varying amplitudes in the inhibition and varying magnitudes. So rate coding that results in the unique transmission of patterns along encoding the synapses of each neuron. This rate coding with varying magnitudes and individually encoded synapses results in the considerate detection and consequent emission.

## 2: Nonlinear Computation and Input Summation in Neurons
So that so, so the neuron with its synaptic configuration represents the considerate to detection because it's detecting in a stepwise, stepwise or computational input. We can say nonlinear input, but basically it's like it's considering the sum of its clustered sum of its inputs over a period of time.

## 3: Clustered Input Summation and Neuron Output Modulation
So a neuron considers the clustered sum of its inputs over time, which is the same as a nonlinear computation. And so that means that it is effectively considering through the weighing of charges, positive and negative charges, the clustering of signals from its diverse dendritic branches of synapses.

## 4: Synaptic Input Processing and Phase Wave Changes in Neurons
It's to be the detected computation of all its inputs over a window of time. And that changes its output in the neuron’s phase wave. So it could, so it has options. It could, it could be, if I had a regular interval, it could seek with other neurons, or it could fire more slowly, it could become inhibited for a while, or it could fire at some faster range.

## 5: Tonic and Phasic Firing Rates in Neurons
And there's, there's, there's, there are multiple faster ranges. So, so, there's the basic action potential that's faster than the tonic action potential. The higher, so the, so the neuron is going to fire regularly at a tonic rate, but it might fire physically at a faster than tonic rate.

## 6: Synaptic Plasticity and Behavioral Time Encoding
And so, there's like this marker, which is like, you know, a standard action potential firing that is faster than the tonic action potential of regular firing. And, and then if that action potential happens again at the same time, then it represents a concurrence of, of, of past future bits, because, so now you have the post-synaptic side of the soma, and the pre-synaptic side of the soma.

## 7: Coincident Detection and Higher Phasic Burst Rates
So, that are going to encode seconds-long coincident detection. This is behavioral time-skeleton after plasticity. They're going to encode seconds-long coincident detections. And this means that the post-synaptic side of the soma, and the pre-synaptic side of the soma, are going to supercharge the action potential event if it happens again at the same time.

## 8: Synaptic Memory and Neuronal Burst Patterns
So, it's like the post-synaptic side of the soma gets encoded with the expectation of when the last speed-up in action potential happens. And the timing of, in that, that is going to send a surge of back propagation from the post-synaptic side of the soma, back force the soma. And if the pattern that they're receiving from the input side matches the post-synaptic side of the soma, then the soma does a burst-rate fire.

## 9: Phasic Burst Frequency Ranges and Neural Interplay
And that's a higher phasic burst. So, at that point, the neuron at least temporarily jumps into a different phase pattern signal. That could be, we could be jumping from like 20 Hz to 40 Hz to 60 Hz to 80 Hz. We could be jumping to 150 Hz. The burst rate signal is like, kind of starts at 150 Hz.

## 10: Maximum Burst Rates and Tonic Phase Interplay
So, we're jumping from whatever we were at 20, 40, 60, or 80 Hz tonically. We're jumping up to 150, or 200, or 300 Hz, or 400 Hz, or 500 Hz, or 600 Hz. The maximum frequencies that are seen in the brain are around 600 Hz.

## 11: High Phasic Burst Frequencies in Animal Brains
In human brains, I don't know if that has been observed in human beings or not, but in animal brains, burst rate frequencies can go between 150 up to 600 Hz in granule cells, for example.

## 12: Interplay Between Gamma Burst and Tonic Theta Patterns
And we can see that there is an interplay between the high phasic burst and the slower tonic burst. For example, there's an interplay between gamma burst and tonic theta patterns.

## 13: Hierarchical Feedback Loop in Brain Activity
So, you know, you can see papers like the one I recently added to the note number one, which basically shows us that when you have the organism driving its own behavior, you can measure the amount of signals coming from the frontal cortex, from a frontal part of the cortex to the back, to the lower part of the cortex.

## 14: Top-Down Feedback in Cortical Activity
You can see that the pattern of signals is that there's a lot more, it's a greater quantity of activity coming from the top down, from the furthest end of the hierarchical feedback loop, backward towards the sensory inputs and outer outputs.

## 15: Cortical Loop Activity in Sensory Processing
And so, there's a direction of activity. I mean, I guess the intention is really towards the outer outputs, but it's like the idea of, you know, stuff goes in through a hierarchy up to the top and then it loops back down to the outer outputs.

## 16: Cyclic Brain Activity and Sensory Loops
So, instead of, you can say it goes up and it cycles, then it goes down and it goes out again. So, you can kind of think of brain activity as like the Sonic the Hedgehog loop, where Sonic goes into the loop from the left side, goes in a big circle upside down and then back outside on the right side.

## 17: Sensory Loops and Cortical Columns
And so, it comes in with an image, you have a loop for each of your senses. And each of those neurons is one of the Sonic the Hedgehog loops. And each cortical column is also like a loop of loops.

## 18: Cortical Columns as Nested Loops
So, each cortical column is like a stack of Sonic the Hedgehog loops in the formation of a loop. And then at the pyramidal cell, at the fifth and the sixth layers, they're going to loop again. At the second and third layers, they're going to loop. And at the fifth and sixth layers, they're going to loop again.

## 19: Thalamic Feedback Loops in Sensory Processing
So, they loop from the fifth and sixth layers back down to the second or third and fourth layers. And they loop into the thalamus from the incoming senses to the neocortex to the first, second, and third layers to the pyramidal cells and from the pyramidal cells from the tops of the pyramidal cells back towards the thalamus and to other pyramidal cells and to the core thalamic neurons.

## 20: Thalamic Matrix Neurons and Cortical Loops
The matrix thalamic neurons in the core thalamic neurons will do feedback loops for the columns, and the matrix thalamic neurons will do loops in between cortical columns.

## 21: Thalamic and Hippocampal Loops in Brain Activity
And then, of course, the thalamus does loops with, or basically like everything loops through the thalamus. The whole brain activity loops through the thalamus, and the thalamus loops through the hippocampus, which is like a special cortical column right in the center.

## 22: Thalamic-Hippocampal-Entorhinal Loop and Motor Output
And so there's this thalamic-hippocampal-entorhinal loop of activity. And then stuff travels from the hippocampus and from other parts of the neurons back down to the brainstem and out the motor branches.

## 23: Motor Signals and Brainstem Pathways
You have your motor signals that are going from your brainstem downwards into your limbic system and out across to your fingers and your toes and your larynx.

## 24: Sensory and Motor Integration in the Brain
And of course, to your eyes, you've got all your different nerve branches, your incoming sensory nerves, but they're also controlling the muscle movement and the position of your eyes and your lungs.

## 25: Mapping the Brain’s Functional Networks
And so that's some more information about the map of the brain.

## 26: Timing of Postsynaptic Neuron Firing and Synaptic Input
And yeah, so we've got, so the timing of what the postsynaptic neuron can fire is not just coming from the previously fired, the postsynaptic side of the soma.

## 27: Regulation of Synaptic Back Propagation
The timing of what the postsynaptic side of the soma is going to do a back propagation signal is not just set by the presynaptic side of the soma. There's also modification of that timing from other neurons through the up-regulation and down-regulation of back propagating signals.

## 28: Synaptic Patterns and Signal Propagation
Back propagating synaptic signals are coming from a postsynaptic neuron to the presynaptic neuron, backwards across the synaptic gap, that are either down-regulating or upward-regulating the synaptic pattern.

## 29: Coincidence Detection in Neuronal Firing
This is the frequency rate in which the exit terminal or the apical dendrite is going to send a back propagating signal towards the soma to basically over-supercharge the soma with a coincident arrival of charges.

## 30: Neural Firing Patterns and Synaptic Transmission
If the back propagating signal to the soma and the dendritic burst arrive at the same time, you get a bursting signal. And so it's like the neuron represents a part of a pattern.

## 31: Sparse Distributed Representations in Neuronal Firing
The idea is that the pattern is like a sparse, distributed internal representation that is rendered when the neuron outputs its pattern through the exit terminal to other neurons. It's rendered when the neuron signals to the next neuron via a rate change and its neurotransmitter release.

## 32: Tonic Firing and Synaptic Up-Regulation
So there's a default that the neuron just repeats the last rate change that it had at a tonic frequency. So it doesn't repeat bursts, but when it's not bursting, it just repeats the tonic rate frequency, which might be 20 Hz, 40 Hz, 60 Hz, or 80 Hz.

## 33: Excitatory and Inhibitory Synaptic Connections
But it is a regular pattern that a neuron does; it's just going to fire an action potential at that frequency. And that encodes part of a pattern in the neuron body, and its synapses will be up-regulated and down-regulated.

## 34: Summation of Synaptic Inputs and Tonic Firing
So they'll have a combination of synaptic connections that result in the summation of its regular tonic firing frequency. And that summation of synapses is going to be a combination of up-regulated and down-regulated synapses, i.e., excited and inhibited synapses.

## 35: Neural Tuning and Cortical Column Synchrony
And so the number of synapses is also going to be firing, and the tuning of its firing rate so that it's firing in the same frequency as its group, as its cortical column, is accomplished through getting regular excitatory signals.

## 36: Pyramidal Neurons and Cortical Column Synchronization
These excitatory signals are distributed from the pyramidal neurons to the thalamic neurons back down to its second and third layer. Excited for a second and third layer, we're talking about the case of the pyramidal cell.

## 37: Soma Excitation and Sensory Input Sensitivity
The cortical columns, the pyramidal cells in the cortical columns, will receive signals that sort of prime the soma to have a certain energy threshold that's more excited than the sensory inputs. So that combined, the sensory inputs, when combined with the level of soma activation, will be more likely to trigger the neuron.

## 38: Soma Excitation and Neuronal Sensitivity
You could have less sensory input, but it can have more effect because there's already charge in the soma that can set the neuron off. And so the amount of excitation of the soma will make the neuron, when it gets more excited, more sensitive to incoming senses.

## 39: Behavioral Motivation and Neuronal Excitation
So neurons get excited, and their excitement goes up, and then they become more sensitive. It's like when a person gets motivated about some topic, like maybe it's about food; you get turned on to the idea of food, you start thinking about food.

## 40: Sensory Focus and Cortical Column Activation
And it's like your soma, there's a pattern of your pyramidal cells that are getting excited in the soma, so they become more sensitive to the concept of food. So you start looking for food and related topics.

## 41: Sensory Expectation and Enhanced Sensitivity
And it doesn't have to be about food now. But maybe you are looking for cheese, and you're walking through the grocery store, and you get excited about cheese. So your brain becomes more sensitive to cheese.

## 42: Pattern Recognition and Neural Excitation
And you start seeing cheese everywhere. You see, like you're walking in the aisle that doesn't have cheese in it, but you notice the parmesan cheese, because the parmesan cheese is sometimes located in the aisle that doesn't have any cheese in it, in a separate place from the rest of the cheese.

## 43: Sensory Bias and Cognitive Focus
You know, you start talking about blue cars. It's the famous saying. And imagine that you have some of your neurons that represent the patterns that your brain associates with cars. They are getting excited, so the inputs of those neurons start to prefer the pattern of cars.

## 44: Neuronal Excitation and Pattern Drift
And this idea is that the aggregate of the excited neurons and the excited cortical columns is distinct enough to reduce the pattern of cars in the rendering of your mind, especially when your sensory inputs coincide with your expectation.

## 45: Predictive Coding and Sensory Priming
So thinking about something is going to excite your internal feedback, which is going to excite your pyramidal cells. They are going to go through the thalamus, through your central processor, and they're going to excite the second and third layer neurons to prime the soma.

## 46: Sensory Input Matching and Burst Firing
They’re changing the timing of the synapses on the apical dendrites so that if you walk across the blue car, after you know, or food, or whatever you have decided to think about, then you're going to get burst firing because now your set expectations will match the incoming sensory patterns.

## 47: Cognitive Priming and Sensory Awareness
And so you're more likely to notice after listening to this, you're more likely to notice cheese at the grocery store and parmesan cheese in particular, especially if it's not in the aisle with the cold cheese. And you're more likely to notice blue cars after listening to this and other cars.

## 48: Focused Thought and Sensory Attention
And anything else that you're thinking about, you're more likely to think about food or something if you were listening to this, like really thinking about it. And you can so whatever you want to think about, that is going to excite certain patterns.

## 49: Cognitive Pattern Formation in Cortical Columns
It will excite certain patterns via a configuration, a learned configuration of cortical column-based patterns that are also excited by the six-layer feedback through the thalamus.

## 50: Interneurons and Cortical Pattern Shaping
But the patterns are also shaped by the interneurons, which are in sync with the pyramidal neurons. So the patterns are also shaped by interneurons that are firing at the same frequency.

## 51: Neural Synchronization and Inhibitory Interneurons
And so neurons that are far, columns of neurons that are firing at the same frequency, and individual neurons from different columns that are firing at the same frequency, can be linked together or blocked from being linked together by the GABAergic inhibitory interneurons.

## 52: Selective Neural Activation and Sensory Representation
And so you get selective patterns of neural activations from different columns that can represent different patterns like cars and houses and boats and cats, and different neural patterns can play through the brain, evoking different kinds of sensory renderings.

## 53: GABAergic Inhibition and Neural Pattern Coordination
And this can happen because the neural path of the sequences that play back in your brain is defined by the inhibitory interneuron GABAergic firing. So the firing, basically the patterns that your brain produces, can be modified in real-time by the GABAergic inhibitory interneurons.

## 54: Interneuron Modulation and Neural Synchrony
Which is in sync with the excitatory tuning of the six-layer pyramidal cells that are routed through the thalamic matrix and thalamic core neurons to provide a loop of feedback to your brain cells.

## 55: Synaptic Configurations and Cognitive Function
And so, in a sense, your mind consists of these configurations, these synaptic configurations of patterns that are changing the individual timing and the combination of the timing of different neural patterns across different cortical columns and within different cortical columns.

## 56: Cortical Columns and Neural Network Connectivity
And so you have connections that are basically configurations of firing patterns across the brain, and they're coordinated through synchrony, and they're connected through, and so signals are coordinated through sequence firing.

## 57: Oscillatory Physics and Brain Function Integration
But thanks to oscillatory physics, the oscillatory firing also binds the signals so that they can be combined by your whole brain into a coherent sensor-transmitter system.

## 58: Burst Rates and Tonic Firing in Cognitive Processing
So the changes, the way the burst rates, the higher phasic burst rates change, the tonic higher magnitude but lower frequency signals, is the process by which your brain is detecting its own information.

## 59: Phasic and Tonic Firing as Cognitive Tools
So the burst rates represent the rendered information, and the tonic rates represent the canvas to which the rendered information is applied.

## 60: Neural Oscillations as the Basis for Cognitive Representation
So the canvas of your mind is the tonic firing rates that are changed by the burst rate firing, which is the pen of your mind. And the interplay between the pen of your mind and the canvas of your mind is shared by the whole mind through the process of the tonic firing absorbing the phasic firing.

## 61: Tonic and Phasic Firing as Cognitive Frameworks
So it's like the pen, the paper absorbs the pen, and that paper is this higher magnitude, lower frequency, and the pen is this higher frequency, low magnitude. Think about the pen ink. Pen ink is a lower frequency, meaning that it's higher magnitude, so it's like this dark line across which you can also have basically like a dark paper with a thin light line.

## 62: Inhibitory Patterns and Slow Wave Potentials
And that would be the negative action potential, which is the slow wave potential, which is slower than the tonic frequency, but it still has that sort of like, it's still recognized by the tonic pattern because of its irregularity because essentially, like whether a pattern is extremely like whether it's a burst pattern or an inhibitory pattern, the point is that it's etching some uncommon signal.

## 63: Memory Replay and Temporal Sequencing
And it's interesting that when things are happening in real time, your memories are played in a forward sequence, and when you think about memories that happened in the past, those memories are played in a backward sequence.

## 64: Burst Firing in Predictive Processing
Now you see this with Buzsaki's work: when you're about to do something, the pattern repeats three times. It repeats really fast, maybe 200 Hz, and then it plays out at the behavioral time scale where you play out that pattern, the same pattern that played at 200 Hz.

## 65: Memory Encoding and Recall Mechanisms
You predicted you're going to do something, and then you do it, and then you remember that you did it. And when you remember that you did it, it plays it back super fast again, but backwards. And those are like the three steps of a burst fire rate.

## 66: Temporal Dynamics of Neural Firing Patterns
When you're about to do something, you think about what you're going to do first, and then you do it. And when you do it, it's happening at the behavioral time scale, which means it's happening much more slowly.

## 67: Behavioral Time Scale and Memory Replay
And then after you're doing it, you get this receipt; basically, the whole sequence plays back really fast backwards. This is what medical imaging shows us.

## 68: Neural Sequences and Task Representation
So basically, the neural path that represents the tasks that you're thinking about plays out really fast, and then you’re doing the steps to get to some goal, and then thinking about what you just did, that path is a sequence of firing.

## 69: Cortical Column and Inter-Columnar Firing Sequences
It might be an original sequence of neural firing across multiple cortical columns that are also locked in a firing sequence.

## 70: Computational Dynamics of Brain Function
So there's firing sequences inside the cortical columns that are coincident with firing sequences inside other cortical columns, and at a higher scale, so there are sequences across cortical columns.

## 71: Brain Computation as a Sequence of Firing Patterns
So it goes back to basically like the computation of the brain is a firing sequence of basically a stepwise, nonlinear or nonlinear, or clustered summation of inputs via the consideration of charges.

## 72: Neuronal Charge Thresholds and Computation
These charges become weighed when they exceed the thresholds, the thresholds that are defined by the capacity of the neuron by its size and its dimensions, and its morphology, which changes, you know, because if the neuron is getting, neurons will grow to adapt to the inputs that they're getting.

## 73: Neuronal Growth and Pathway Shaping
And this causes the preference of certain patterns, but this also shapes neural paths. When neurons grow or form long-term memories, this also shapes the path at which signals will travel. So it shapes the preference of how signals will travel.

## 74: Long-Term Memory and Signal Pathways
So brains have long-term changes happening on an individual neuron scale, and this changes the computation at the neuron level, at the cortical column level, and at the inter-cortical column level.

## 75: Neural Networks and Collective Computation
So the network of the brain is basically a network of individual neuronal computation that is networked together in collective neuronal computation through cortical columns and through thalamic net loops.

## 76: Learned Patterns and Behavioral Sequences
And this results in a vast array of pattern configurations, or basically combinations of learned patterns, that result in sequences of behaviors, learned sequences of behaviors that connect to rewards.

## 77: Adaptive Pathways and Consequence-Based Learning
These pathways are continually modified to drive new consequences or new rewards, which are also a type of consequence, whether they be rewards or penalties, but basically new consequences.

## 78: Neural Computation and Environmental Navigation
So as an organism navigates the environment with this neural computation, the development of these pathways continues.

## 79: Conclusion on Brain Computation and Learning
And yeah, that's basically it.
