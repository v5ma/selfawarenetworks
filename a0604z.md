the brain is feeling the wave patterns of the room
it is interacting with spacetime feeling our electromagnetism

Biochemistry Focus webinar series: Alpha-synuclein, a central player in neurodegenerative diseases


The link between Parkinson's Disease & T-Cells means that there might be an immunotherapy treatment for Parkinson's Disease https://neurosciencenews.com/parkinsons-t-cells-20233/amp/

Immunotherapy Cart T Cancer
Advanced brain & body imaging could be used to track the progress of immunotherapy treatments to figure out what the patients reaction is to the therapy faster so that therapy can be adjusted as needed for each patient.

# "Protective Effects of Polysaccharides in Neurodegenerative Diseases"
"Polysaccharides (/ˌpɒliˈsækəraɪd/), or polycarbohydrates, are the most abundant carbohydrates found in food. They are long chain polymeric carbohydrates composed of monosaccharide units bound together by glycosidic linkages. "
" In this review, we demonstrate that various polysaccharides mediate NDs, and share several common mechanisms characterized by autophagy, apoptosis, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction in PD and AD. Furthermore, this review reveals potential role of polysaccharides in vitro and in vivo models of NDs, and highlights the contributions of polysaccharides and prospects of their mechanism studies for the treatment of NDs."

Are they going to treat your brain with carbohydrates? lol
