This conversation began after a clubhouse conversation where a paper called "General Anesthesia Decouples Cortical Pyramidal Neurons"

This paper "General Anesthesia Decouples Cortical Pyramidal Neurons" was a key paper in my thinking that crystalized or kernelized NAPOT: Neural Array Projection Oscillatory Tomography. Specifically the "Oscillatory" part of NAPOT. György Buzsaki's work on Oscillations at the EEG scale + Steven Strogatz's concept work applying the math & physics of Oscillation to Clocks, Fireflies, and Neurons also helped, but it was the fact that oscillatory feedback was decoupled during anesthesia that crystalized the idea for me. It fit with my previous conceptualization that consciousness was like a temporarly active rendered pattern. A thought pattern is something that our brains can detect inside our minds, the same way that our eyes can detect patterns in the world around us, because the thought pattern like the world around us is a pattern that is consistent over time, it cycles or oscillates repeatedly over time, so that our minds can perceive it.

# "General Anesthesia Decouples Cortical Pyramidal Neurons"
"The mystery of general anesthesia is that it specifically suppresses consciousness by disrupting feedback signaling in the brain" (NAPOT explains this: Consciousness requires Oscillation, the feedback cycle is part of the oscillation. Anesthesia disrupts the oscillation cycle, and signals have to oscillate to be conscious. Your models of reality, in your cell activity, have to be triggered repeatedly over time & space in your brain in a feedback loop, an oscillating cycle.)
"If feedback signaling occurs predominantly through apical dendrites, the cellular mechanism we found would explain not only how anesthesia selectively blocks this signaling but also why conscious perception depends on both cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical connectivity."

Confirm differences between apical dendrites and basal dendrites

A 1 on 1 Conversation that took place on Clubhouse about Dendritic Computation: Potassium channels, Calcium channels, and Plateau Potentials.

I can't recall who this is that I'm talking to but it could be Wisam, not sure. So for now I will refer to the speaker as W: and to myself as Micah:

00:00

W:
They send out roots, the basal dendrites, and they have this big trunk that a shoots up the trunk up, the cell bodies are in layer five of the cortex, and then they shoot the trunk up. And then there's just big arborization of dendrites in layer one.

00:18

W:
And the paper we were talking about in Paul's room (Paul King's Clubhouse Online Chat Room), they they were talking about it in terms of two compartments, which would just be the big arborization in layer one versus the somatic compartment.

W:
And there are interesting things that happen when the two compartments interact. You can get these calcium spikes in the dendrite and you can get the cell to burst.

00:51

W:
So that's what they were talking about, then that what they were doing was reading out that burst rate.

So they use anesthetics and then they measured the change in burst probability with that mechanism in mind.

Micah:
So it sounded to me during that recording, that the anesthesia was somehow inhibiting the action potential from happening, but the action potential was being inhibited because the anesthesia was specifically acting to inhibit interaction between the Soma and the other section of the neuron...are we talking about the dendritic arbor?

W:
Yeah, so if you put on anesthesia those compartments are decoupled. In other words they can't interact with each other. You don't get that bursting effect that you would normally get.

Micah:
but what do they mean by a coupled? Are they do? Does that mean that they're oscillating together at the same frequency?

W:
It means the synaptic activity in the dendrite is enough to cause the soma to burst on and it can go the other way.

02:17

Micah:
Is the Soma burst the same as the beginning of an action potential?

W:
Yeah, you can have single spikes, right? Sodium in Potassium out. There is coding for spike rate, and with single spikes you can even code with timing. But then there's a very different type of behavior where the cell bursts very rapidly in a, you know, very small window of time. They're starting to call that burst....

Micah:
Their's sodium, and there's also the chloride.

 
W:
Yeah. Chloride is a pretty small part of the, you know, the classic Hodgekin & Huxley style action potential. It (Chloride) usually plays in after the action potential. or where exactly the threshold ends up being for firing, but it's the big snap. The big spike is sodium in, the sodium channels desensitize and then you have this slower on set of potassium pushing out which shuts down the the spike.
That's like the main component.

Micah:
Okay? So a big question, I want to ask you was, how does the let's say, let's say that you, you show some what you show. So let's say that we could, we could watch the activity of of a dendrite, you know, with the sensor that just doesn't exist yet.

03:57

Micah:
Right, let's say we could walk really watch the dendrite while we showed somebody like one picture. And then we showed someone another picture and that the point of this is that the dendrite is supposed to recognize a part of this picture. That's the point of this experiment.
We're gonna put two pictures and the dendrites gonna recognize a pattern from this picture, and then that's going to potentially result in a change in the potassium.
That's what I'm thinking, it's gonna change the Potassium, and the potassium is going to change the shape of the action potential and the shape of the action potential is going to change the the total quantity of neurotransmitters that that flood out from the exit terminal in multi-vesicle sacks
so that's what I'm driving at, how how is the dendrite recognizing a pattern that's going to change the amount of potassium, because I think and I've talked to other people, I think that there's enough
research also that says. What is going to cause the change in the shape of the action potential may come down to the duration of the action potential, like when it's when it's closed and if there's more potassium concentration, then the dendrite might close at a different time interval.
And that's going to change the amplitude or frequency of the action potential. So that's an idea. I don't know what you think about. Yeah.

W:
So I like if you change the rest, like, let's say, you, you're injecting a current. And so one, one thing I meant to say earlier that my clarify some things, the some of the stuff I've been saying applies to really large cells, right?

06:24

W: 
So, if you have like a smaller pyramidal or interneuron, you don't have this distance dependent compartmentalization that happens. It's a different type compartmentalization.

Micah:
Yeah, you were talking about what pyramidal cells are what?

W:
Yeah, exactly,

Micah:
Pyramidal cells the six layers cells.

W: 
That's what they were talking about in the paper to.

06:46

Micah:
Yes. Right. The apical apical and basal compartments.

W:
yep. so in a smaller cell than with when the soma fires, there is back propagation to all the synapses. So that's, you know. So it depends, it's very cell type dependent

but to what you're saying. So let's just talk about a smaller cell like that.

Let's say you're applying current on synapses in the branches (of the dendrite) then you're certainly gonna change with the resting (potential voltage) (during that stimulus) that you're gonna temporarily change the resting (potential) voltage for the soma and changing that voltage has consequences for set points for the (ion) channels that are involved.

07:36

Also when those those channels are going to become desensitized, so sure you could definitely end up controlling the shape or even like the timing of when the spiking happens with synaptic inputs. I think that's what you're getting at.

Micah:
Yeah, I'm wondering how

W:
... the affecting sodium. You could be affecting potassium, like you were saying.

08:05

Micah:
Yeah. But more specifically...


W:
all those channels could get affected. And then relevant for plasticity is calcium, you certainly could be modifying the responsive calcium channels as well.

Micah:
and yeah so that's right. That's part of the hypothesis that I'm working on but specifically potassium like 
What's known in terms of how a dendrite might... so a dendrite might receive a unique pattern activation via its (receptor) inputs, that may have been triggered by by other cells, and so (potentially) a Dendrite has a unique pattern, each time.

08:59

Micah:
And somehow those synapses on each of the branches of the dendrite are sending us. You know, a summary of what they're whatever they're collecting. They're sending a summary whatever they're collecting that represents part of that pattern and it's resulting. It it is perhaps being transformed or resulting in some sort of change to the amount of sodium, some sort of changes the amount of potassium and down the road, you know, changes to the what the calcium receptors are doing, or how much... I'm actually not sure what what changes gonna it's gonna make to the calcium receptors exactly. Because this is a little bit of the gray area for me, like, well, how a synapse is going to increase or decrease The potassium Delta.
I'm not sure what to the.

W: 
So it will change the potential and the potential can affect the voltage, it's going to put the the channels at a different set point.
So I would think about it in terms of: the permutability to different ions is going to change.
So the conductance for each of these ions is so... The current itself isn't changing the... that change in voltage is going to change your permeability to different types of ions.

10:52

There's this paper, I should show you. It was done in the hippocampus, and I basically am hypothesizing that this mechanism is happening in the cortex, but nobody's nailed that yet.

The paper outlines what they call

W:
# "behavioral time synaptic plasticity" and it's in the hippocampus,

and what they show is.

11:21

As the mouse is running along a track, depending on how fast that mouse is running along the track, more and more of the place field code will converge on to single cells, and in other words, the so as these inputs are targeting different parts of the tree,

W:
# this plateau potential we were talking about is long enough to allow the dendrite to integrate across a sequence pattern
So it's a pattern overtime on the dendritic tree that the neuron is able to learn in one shot,
all it needs is one plateau potential and it can learn a place field.

12:07

Micah:
Oh, that makes sense. That makes total sense.

W:
# Yes, and that is because this calcium potential lasts for seconds. So you have time to integrate a pattern in time.

Micah: Wow, that's profound that. I'm imagining the dendrite as a tensor like when you have a matrix times a matrix
you have like nine matrixes and they are al three dimensional, ait's like one cube, and each cube has nine more matrices, and it's like each section of the cube
anyway.
 
W: 
And I'm thinking about the how that implication of that in protection because that's that coupling mechanism and that's not something you can just abstract away by putting more neurons in a network? You need a mechanism that's coupling compartments, and that's why I think about neurons as computers rather than you know single bits being flipped.

# END CONVERSATION

Thoughts:
the longer a mouse travels in looping track, the more place field code is encoded at its reward locations (in a tonic oscillation)
(alternatively) one plateau potential (I think he meant one action potential which has a plateau phase) is enough for a dendrite to integrate a pattern over time. 

# Regarding note: b0232y Plateau Potential

A video on youtube called "Cosyne 2021" inside this video is a 20 minute talk by Sebi Rolotti The Lonsonczy Lab Columbia University in New York svr2111@columbia.edu

Start watching the video at the 20:49 second mark. The talk ends roughly at the 40 minute mark.
You will see the first slide and the title of his talk "Inhibitory feedback control of BTSP induction in CA1 (Hippocampus)"
It's a study on "Behavior TimeScale Synaptic Plasticity (BTSP)" which is what I was searching for when I came across this talk.

Paraphrasing the video: Place cells form following large action potentials. The place field is evidenced by reliable burst firing in that area when the mouse in that same place in later laps. Injecting electrical current can also cause place field formation at that location. It was later found out that this works when current is injected in an area where there is a small cluster of cells verses a large cluster.

He then contrasts his work with a contradictory study by György Buzsáki.

Paraphrasing The per capita stimulation receive, per cell stimulation responds depends on the amount of stimulation a cell receives, it will get less stimulation if it has more neighboring cells, because the neighboring cells help dissipate or dividing the voltage injected into the region. This might explain why evolution preferred siloed cortical columns, because without silos the injected current would cause any spikes, it would just be dissipated by the whole brain without individual cell learning.

Buzsáki's contradictory research, amounts to stimulation given to larger quantity of place cells, resulting in a lower per cell reception of charge, ie the charge each cell received was equivalent to the tonic oscillation or guassian noise.

"Inhibitory Dread Rescues Induction Efficacy"

Place field markers result from reward discovery in some location, and so recurring place field activations are burst potentials, and this indicates to the organism that something is special about that location, so the mouse might intently search for rewards in that location.

What I hypothesize is special about the cortical columns, after watching this video, is that the electrically insulated siloed columns create a specific cell density controlled region, that creates the right electrical conditions for incoming voltage to trigger action potentials. When the density of cells is much greater it is more difficult for action potentials to occur, and for memories to form.
