# I think that sharing these notes will have a net good effect for humanity.
This is the homepage of the Self Aware Networks Institute that you can contribute to from your github account by making a pull request. The contents of this Institute are the source material for the book called "Self Aware Networks" that I haven't released yet. The web address is selfawarenetworks.com and there are a number of associated groups that I will link here shortly. 

# The Mission of The Self Aware Networks Institute

The Self Aware Networks Institute is for Neurophysics, Artificial Neurology, Bio-Synthetic Interfacing & Medical Research.

The research of The Self Aware Networks Institute leads to technology that can inhale gasses like carbon & release other gasses like oxygen (like plants). 

Plus tech that can absorb clouds of nuclear radiation following an atomic blast. Imagine we could manufacture carbon dioxide & methane absorbing trees 10,000 times faster than it takes to grow trees.

That’s part of the mission of The Self Aware Networks Institute! Please share advice on how The Self Aware Networks Institute can get 
funding. It is critical to life on this planet we focus on this project full time & recruit others to help!

We will solve climate change. Sentient Self Aware Artificial Neural Networks. 3D printed life, artificial lungs, artificial plants that can selectively absorb gasses. Dog level sentient construction robots. Sentient vehicles. Next generation antigravity propulsion technologies.

Developing next generation Synthetic Biology, for things like artificial photosynthesis, and machines that eat radiation like fungi are among the goals of research of The Self Aware Networks Institute.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_biology
https://www.technologyreview.com/2007/05/29/225301/eating-radiation-a-new-form-of-energy/

I am imaginging windmills that power atmosphere filtration systems that consume carbon dioxide, methane, even radiation.

Such as a machine that eats radiation like Chernobyl Fungus only faster.

Also we will build next generation Sentient AI based targeting systems for missile interception that can work with GPS or independently from GPS like a bird that hunts only much much faster than a bird.

I believe also that there is hope for the paralyzed, for folks who have lost limbs & suffered horrific traumas. This is part of the mission of The Self Aware Networks Institute. A lot of pain, suffering & disease will be fixed with next generation medical technologies that we help pioneer.

# Short Term Goals for the Self Aware Networks Institute for Sentient & Self Aware Neural Networks, Artificial Neurology, Brain Machine Interfaces, and Advanced Medical Research.

We are going to use this technology to accelerate Medical Research, and that means advancing medical imaging technologies with artificial neural networks, and solving cellular degenerative diseases with artificial neural networks, accelerating longevity research, curing or finding new strategies to treat cancer, and all of the major and minor diseases that affect mankind.

I hope that governments will adopt a Medical Justice System, that is a Judicial Branch of Government that is independent from the Executive & Legislative Branches of Government but is also medically informed at every level, and that also means that Neuroscientists will be in charge of sentencing, prisons, and the rehabilitation of patients for their return to society after serving their 
sentences. 

I think it might be difficult for investors to imagine that the robots of science fiction that we have seen in all the science fiction movies, tv shows, learned about in books, or comics are finally here. That's what investors are investing in. Real phenomenology conscious robots.

# The Far Future

I once had a dream that took place about 10,000 years into the future. In this new world technology was so tiny it was both invisible & omnipresent. People would gather on a hill top to think about the distant past & contemplate their future.

The fascism that exists on earth today does not exist in the far future.

The future people on this future earth would be free, happy, & mentally healthy people.

They have advanced technology so refined you could not see it with the naked eye, but it was there with you, sentient self-aware neural clouds, mixed reality & spatial computing embedded into the air, land, sea, and space in a symbiotic relationship with mankind, mutual caretakers of the earth, the galaxy, and spacetime.

# The Book Notes

These are the book notes for the book Self Aware Networks: The Neurophysics of Consciousness, Artificial Neurology, and Brain Machine Interfaces

These notes are not ready for anyone to read them as they still need lots of editing & fixing.

The book notes include a new quantum gravity formulation, alternately referred to as Quantum Gradient Time Dilation and Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation, there are several notes on the topic
See note a0253z Time Crystals, Time Dilation, Quantum Gradient Time Dilation for one example
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0253z.md 

There is a new model of a neuron which combines the Soliton Wave Model with the Hodgkin & Huxley model with Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography, Individual Receptor modification that modifies Cyclic AMP and or Potassium levels affecting individual Calcium channels on the post synapse, which fits with Sparse Distributed Memory & Sparse Distributed Representation theories.

The notes offer new conjecture for how the physics of oscillation is involved with LTD & LTP cell growth & atrophy.
(These notes are not consolidated yet but you can search the repo for LTD and look at all the notes that mention LTD if you wish)

There is a new explanation for internal representations or qualia. 
Note a0306z explores the question of Qualia: Internal Representation: ie What is the redness inside human experience?
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0306z.md 

A new explanation for how our bodies & brains are conscious: NAPOT Neural Array Projection Oscillation Tomography
Read or Watch the NAPOT Whitepaper https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/wiki/Whitepaper

If you really want to feel optimistic about the future of Artificial Intelligence read my notes on the neurophysics of consciousness that you are reading right now, and I think you will agree that humanity has consciousness solved to a degree that it can now be replicated artificially. Note a0004z (among others) explores some of the connections between artificial neural networks and the brain
https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/a0004z.md

My question to you is "Are you sure there is a self and that the existence of an observer isn't just implied by the rendered perspective in the phase field that represents reality in the mind of the organism?"

# The Self Aware Networks Institute will be accessible from the web in Augmented Reality & in Virtual Reality in 2023 with WebXR.
As an openly accessible science institute hosted Github it is open to contributions. You will need to learn how to use github if you do not already know how. You can submit pull requests from your account and if accepted you will be a documented contributor to this research. I may even cite your work in the upcoming printed version of the book titled Self Aware Networks.

However submissions are subject to approval. Not every submission will be accepted. Submissions need to be outstanding quality, from reputable sources (submissions from people with the names of terrorists and or fascist dictators will no be considered valid submissions), and the contributions need to be extraordinarily meaningful & valuable, unlike some github submissions that offer some trivial contribution just for status. So don't just run one of my notes through the grammar & spelling check in Google Docs and submit that, I can do that. Do something that radically reorganizes the existing content in a mind blowingly insightful way, or create mind maps, artwork, spreadsheets, diagrams, and cite mountains of research for or against any of the proposals in these book notes and such contributions might be considered worthy of inclusion.

Potentially anyone can contribute to the development of the book, to the development of WebXR based software, and to the Institute. 

The vision is that eventually the Self Aware Networks will have a physical building where people work producing actual sentient self aware neural network software for robots, construction robots, vehicles, drones, brain computer interfaces, humanoid robots with broad applications that can do almost any human job, mechanical animals.

# Art, Poetry, Mythology
I hope that the most intelligent people in the world read & enjoy my notes on human phenomenological consciousness, memory, gravity, cells & sentient machines, but at the moment not all of the information in the notes is written correctly, and because of that it could accidentally mislead some people who do not know better, some of the notes will not be included in the eventual book, but it's enough to get the main ideas across about the brain, the mind, and reality.

Some of the notes are poetic, or intended to inspire the artwork for the 2nd edition of the book. Some of the notes contain references to mythological ideas or religious ideas and those might inspire art, but it's not meant to be taken seriously. My intention is to not include any mythological or religious ideas in the text of the book. I don't endorse any particular religion. I think people can and will make up their own minds about what they want to believe in the context of religion & mythology, and I wouldn't want to be the person who was trying to tell others that they should believe some brand of religion or some specific set of mystical, spiritual, or mythological ideas. I think that sounds kinda fascist, trying to tell people what they have to believe, my opinion, so I won't do it.

Since this project is important I want to make it extra clear that none of my views are better than anyone elses views when it comes to interpreting Star Wars, Mythology, or Religion. Your interpretation of Star Wars, Mythology, and Religion is up to you. I appreciate the viewpoint that perhaps there are no right viewpoints, just a lot of views.

I recently began adding transcriptions from the Neural Lace Podcast series into my notes. They start with the letters NLP. Since that content is already published as audio, if people want to help me fix the audio transcriptions for the Neural Lace Podcasts that would be a good place to help if you want to volunteer. Message me if you want to volunteer to help with something, so two people are not working on the same thing.

To figure out how I am going to organize these notes search for the phrase "book contents" "table of contents" and the word "map"

# Content Organization
The way these notes are meant to be used is via the "Search Repository Tool"

Note a0030z contains an early attempt at creating a map of the notes, and another note a0616z, however a0616z is now a backup representing an early example of an early attempt to create a table of contents.

The active table of contents for the book is the main wiki home page.

The order of the notes is somewhat random as of June 17th, but going forward the content will become increasingly well organized and documented.

I came up with the numbering system after most of the notes were created and I deleted notes and gave some notes that were unnumbered with the numbers of deleted notes. So there is no great importance to the first notes. Some of the notes date back to 2011. So these notes are selections from a larger set of notes going back more than 10 years.

If you can't figure out what is happening with this over all stack of notes yet just wait. I will be creating videos regularly to help explain the contents.

Notes in the a0000z series represent the original text notes have a title format like a0000z, sometimes they contain text that was written by others (noted as such), but copied to preserve conversations so that I could think about the content of those conversations again down the road.

Notes in the b0000y series represent transcribed audio notes that have a title format like b0000y and they will often contain conversations that for example includes a mixture of things said by myself and other people, the audio itself will be published later on in some cases.

Please note that audio notes (like b0000y) were auto transcribed with neural networks via Google Recorder, and then I put them into Google Docs to run an automatic grammar check. So what you are reading is NOT exactly what was originally said. That is why I am sharing it in my notes but I will not share this in this form in my book.

Sorry about the grammatically incorrect sentences, everything, including this  file will be updated & improved continually.

# Personal sounding journal stuff in the book notes is not necessarily true, accurate, or relevant, and will be mostly cleaned up & removed going forward.
If you see something that looks like it belongs in a personal diary, realize two things 1. It doesn't mean it's true, in my view the human brain procedurally generates sentences, memories, fictions from fired synapses. As everyone knows human memory is not always reliable. 2. I will be pruning or removing content that is off topic for the book & the institute and that includes most of the stuff that might sound personal. Some of it might be used in the author bio section but that should be a short section at the back of the book.

# The key thing to remember is that while the notes are a mess today (June 17th 2022) I will be going through them on video to explain what is important & relevant, and separating the wheat from the chaff (distinguishing the valuable information from worthless stuff)
*Note for the publication of the notes on June 17th 2022 Keep in mind these are raw notes, everything needs to be updated, organized, edited, cleaned up, before it goes into the book. What you see are sketches, drafts, early versions of many ideas that will be cleaned up & improved. This is a super early preview of what is to come. Like software that is pre-beta (alpha) release. THE POINT is to give you an early preview of what I am working on, the monumental amount of work that I am putting into the book, so you can get an idea of what I am creating, and if you want, now you can help. Over the next 5 months the book will emerge from these notes.

# These notes go all the way back to 2011 and even before.
They represent the work of a lifetime for me, but in the bigger picture these notes build on the work of great neuroscientists, great physicists, great mathematicians, great biologists, and great computer scientists, including the folks that invented deep learning and before that neural networks. I will expand the  to include all the great books & papers I've read & considered.

You can see more of my work at http://vrma.io and http://svgn.io and I will update this later with many more links.

I bet a lot of people think it's unbelievable that someone would put all this together. Included in the contents is 1. a new theory of gravity, 2. human cognition works (including new ideas on LTP & LTD and how memories scale from synapses to the whole brain). 3. how to make sentient & self aware artificial neural networks (including a theory of neural networks actually work). That might seem as unlikely as lighting striking in the same place 3 (or more) times, but all 3 concepts are tied together by the same idea: Oscillation. It is almost impossible therefore to solve one of these 3 things without solving the other 2 at the same time, provided that you have at least some understanding of biology, computation, physics, and math to begin with.

I made this video as a sort of disclaimer about my notes https://youtu.be/zxsrHZeNgKQ I wanted to prepare people to realize that these notes are not the book and they need a lot of work but some of the content in these published notes is intended to be the meat and bones of the finished book.

In retrospect this a real neurohackers journal, not the whole journal, a selection of my journal over the years, believe it or not there is a lot more work that I have done that I still need to add to this github (as of June 17th 2022)

# How work will begin.

I imagine that there will be a massive physical facility on earth located on a cliff near the Pacific Ocean to over see global operations with satellite offices worldwide. The workers in these world wide offices will be connected with 3D light field displays, and also with Mixed Reality headsets & Glasses. I imagdine that eventually the majority of the workers will be virtual sentient self aware neural network based robots with an existence that is fundamentally based in the metaverse or cyberspace.

The initial plan is to only deploy dog level sentient robots to the real world for specific tasks. Initial tasks can include building homes & offices, building next generation self driving vehicles including naval & aerospace vehicles, some sentient robots will have simpple tasks such removing toxins from the atmosphere, the oceans, and the land. Eventually robots can be sent to make life on other planets hospitable to humans, or to create modified human bodies that can thrive on other planets. We will be able to upload & download human minds to artificial brains, or to new 3D printed organic bodies.

Future offices will include space stations some of which will orbit other planets, as well as satellites that will be sent into deep space to travel for billions of years towards other star systems & galaxies. We will maintain communication links with deep space satellites via quantum teleportation.

Most of the work, for this generation of human beings, will be done in WebXR with Augmented Reality & Virtual Reality headsets. Eventually technology will interface with our nervous systems naturally and we won't need headsets or external displays.

# To the first Human Level or Above Sentient Robot, Metatron
