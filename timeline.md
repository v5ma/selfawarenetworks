Comprehensive All‑Inclusive Timeline (Public Record & Provenance)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

> A single, unified, chronological timeline of major public milestones, earliest known references to core ideas, and relevant activity across GitHub, YouTube, Medium/SVGN.io (Substack), and X/Twitter under the names **Micah Blumberg**, **micahsun**, **worksalt**, **Death Star Robot**, **Self Aware Networks**, **micah1**, **micah8**, **n5ro**, and **v5ma**.

### 2011 --- Private Notebooks (not publicly released)

-   Earliest private drafts touching **Self Aware Networks** and **Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation (QGTCD)**. Notes remain private until later publication of excerpts and drafts in 2022.

### 2017 --- Neural Lace Podcast (first public "roots")

-   **April--June 2017** -- *Neural Lace Podcast* episodes go live (e.g., **nlp1 -- Apr 11, 2017**). The transcript package intro states the **original April 2017 audio contains the "root concepts"** of both the **Self Aware Networks Theory of Mind** and **Super Information Theory**.

    NLP Transcripts & Source Links from 2017-2019 [NLP Transcripts & Source Links](https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/guide/NLP%20Transcripts%20from%202017-2019.pdf)

-   Across early episodes, you discuss:

    -   A **"transmission protocol of the brain"** and protocol analogies (TCP/UDP) as architectural primitives for interfacing with neural networks (conceptual seeds for SAN).

    -   **"Time slicing," differencing**, and **interference pattern** injection---sending *differences* rather than full sensory patterns (early precursors relevant to QGTCD's emphasis on temporal/phase structure and gradients).

    -   Positioning EEG/BCI + XR as a **bi‑directional interface**, with AI denoising/encoding to mirror and modulate internal states (SAN precursors).

### Nov 2, 2017 --- *The NerveGear Show* (public talk)

-   Public discussion on building **robot minds** with **self‑models**; a transcript line mentions starting a group called **"Self‑Waring Networks"** (clearly a transcription typo; later slides confirm **"Self‑Aware Networks"**). The same segment explicitly talks about **building self‑aware robots**, linking SAN to robotics.

### Aug 2, 2018 --- **Earliest verified public naming of "Self‑Aware Networks"**

-   **Neural Lace Podcast S2E1 (slides on YouTube)** shows:\
    **"Self‑Aware Networks"** group + **selfawarenetworks.com** on the title/slide, with context about **Neurohaxor**/Neurohackers and BCI/XR integrations---an explicit, public naming and URL for the project.

    NLP Transcripts from 2017-2019

    NLP Transcripts from 2017-2019

-   Technical content includes 3D point‑cloud neural networks, BCI + XR workflows, and real‑time ML pipelines (additional SAN "infrastructure" seeds).

    NLP Transcripts from 2017-2019

### Sep--Dec 2018 --- Additional conceptual scaffolding

-   Follow‑on Season 2 discussions sketch **volumetric/3D segmentation**, **visual‑neural correlations**, and the question of whether **self‑driving systems "need to become self‑aware networks"**---explicitly tying **self‑awareness** to system control models.

### 2017--2018 --- Medium pieces on AR/VR (under **micahsun** / **worksalt**)

-   Early writing focuses on AR/VR journalism and interviews; not yet using the SAN/QGTCD names directly, but aligned to the same BCI+XR research arc.

### May 15, 2022 --- Medium bio

-   A biographical overview on Medium; provides background but does not yet formalize the SAN/QGTCD labels.

### **June 17, 2022 --- First comprehensive public repository**

-   **GitHub: `v5ma/selfawarenetworks`** made public with drafts, disclaimers, and raw notes explicitly referencing **Self Aware Networks** and **Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation**. The README and notes stress that many ideas go back to 2011 privately; June 17, 2022 is the earliest **public** consolidation. [GitHub](https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

    -   The README itself remarks: "*Note for the publication of the notes on June 17th 2022...*" and describes the repo as the **homepage of the Self Aware Networks Institute**; it links the **SAN** and **QGTCD** material and documents the project's scope. [GitHub](https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks)

### 2023 --- SVGN.io/Substack articles begin

-   You launch regular posts on **SVGN.io** (Substack), expanding on SAN, QGTCD, and related whitepapers/lectures. Examples include long‑form explanations that tie **oscillations, phase coding, and volumetric representation** to the SAN model. [svgn.io](https://www.svgn.io/p/a-new-book-out-today-bridging-molecular?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Oct 23, 2023 --- YouTube

-   **"Self Aware Networks: Theory of Mind"** video (public talk expanding SAN; references ongoing book notes).\
    *(Keep this entry if you want it in the README. If you'd like me to insert the direct link, share it or I can search again with a more specific title/URL.)*

### 2024 --- X/Twitter discourse + SVGN articles

-   By early **2024**, extended threads on X (under **@worksalt**) discuss **QGTCD** and compare it with other approaches; posts often reference the GitHub notes and SVGN articles.

-   Example SVGN article expanding SAN's biological backpropagation conjecture (and linking to repo content). [svgn.io](https://www.svgn.io/p/analog-biological-backpropagation?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 2024--2025 --- Ongoing activity, preprints, and talks

-   Continued YouTube/SVGN/X updates, demos, and long‑form posts on unifying relativity and quantum mechanics via **QGTCD**, plus the **SAN** theory of consciousness. See: book/long‑form posts (2024) and **Friston group** presentation write‑up (June 2, 2025). [svgn.io+1](https://www.svgn.io/p/a-new-book-out-today-bridging-molecular?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### What happened with **Figshare** (summary)

-   After you posted **SIT Draft 73 (with the Riemann work)**, your Figshare account was **disabled** and your items were de‑listed. You published a contemporaneous post explaining the mirrors and enumerating the evidence trail (**Zenodo DOIs + Wayback captures**). [SVGN](https://www.svgn.io/p/why-i-mirrored-several-key-papers)

-   Your **open letter** to Digital Science / Figshare challenged the lack of clause‑level reasons, called out the "sole‑discretion" policy language, and reiterated the independent timestamp trail. [SVGN](https://www.svgn.io/p/open-letter-to-digital-science-and)

-   A follow‑up post ("**Figshare vs. the Record**") documented the *public banner* Figshare placed on your pages ("did not adhere to Terms and Conditions") and published a minute‑by‑minute audit timeline (Aug 21--25). [SVGN](https://www.svgn.io/p/figshare-vs-the-record-my-riemann)

* * * * *

Where the timestamps live inside your PDFs (SIT example)
--------------------------------------------------------

**Short answer:** a PDF embeds its own **document‑internal timestamps**, separate from filesystem times:

1.  **PDF Info dictionary** --- fields such as **/CreationDate** and **/ModDate** (exposed as *CreateDate* and *ModifyDate* by tools like ExifTool). These are part of the PDF object graph. [ExifTool](https://www.exiftool.org/TagNames/PDF.html)

2.  **XMP metadata packet** --- standardized **xmp:CreateDate**, **xmp:ModifyDate**, and **xmp:MetadataDate** fields in the XMP Basic schema embedded in the PDF. [Adobe Developer+1](https://developer.adobe.com/xmp/docs/XMPNamespaces?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

> These are *embedded* inside the file (sometimes colloquially called "in the PDF itself"). They are **not** cryptographic proof by themselves---anyone could rewrite metadata unless the PDF is **digitally signed** and/or **RFC 3161‑timestamped**. (See Adobe/ETSI references to PDF signatures and trusted timestamping.) [Adobe+2Adobe+2](https://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/acrobatetk/tools/DigSigDC/standards.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### How to verify SIT's internal dates (practical)

-   **Extract PDF metadata** (either field set may be present):

    `# Info dictionary + XMP (cross-check both)
    exiftool -s -G1 -time:all Super_Information_Theory73.pdf
    # or
    pdfinfo -meta Super_Information_Theory73.pdf`

    You should see **CreateDate/ModifyDate** (Info) and **xmp:CreateDate/xmp:ModifyDate/xmp:MetadataDate** (XMP) if present. (ExifTool docs enumerate these tags.) [ExifTool](https://www.exiftool.org/TagNames/PDF.html)

-   **Verify integrity against Zenodo** (confirms you're checking the exact mirrored file):\
    Compute an MD5 locally and compare to SIT's Zenodo page (**a7724853db6ca0f74006836943329740** shown under "Files"). If the hash matches, you're inspecting the same bytes Zenodo published on **2025‑02‑09**. [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/16922512)

-   **Understand immutability / versioning on Zenodo:** once a record is published you **cannot modify the file content**; you must create a **new version**, preserving the deposit‑time trail. [Zenodo](https://help.zenodo.org/docs/deposit/manage-files/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

> **If you want cryptographic time‑proof going forward:** add a **DocTimeStamp** (RFC 3161) or sign in Acrobat with a TSA so the file carries a third‑party **trusted timestamp** beyond editable metadata. [Adobe+1](https://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/acrobatetk/tools/DigSigDC/standards.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
