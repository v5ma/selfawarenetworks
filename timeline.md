Comprehensive All‑Inclusive Timeline (Public Record & Provenance)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

> A single, unified, chronological timeline of major public milestones, earliest known references to core ideas, and relevant activity across GitHub, YouTube, Medium/SVGN.io (Substack), and X/Twitter under the names **Micah Blumberg**, **micahsun**, **worksalt**, **Death Star Robot**, **Self Aware Networks**, **micah1**, **micah8**, **n5ro**, and **v5ma**.

### 2011 --- Private Notebooks (not publicly released)

-   Earliest private drafts touching **Self Aware Networks** and **Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation (QGTCD)**. Notes remain private until later publication of excerpts and drafts in 2022.

### 2017 --- Neural Lace Podcast (first public "roots")

-   **April--June 2017** -- *Neural Lace Podcast* episodes go live (e.g., **nlp1 -- Apr 11, 2017**). The transcript package intro states the **original April 2017 audio contains the "root concepts"** of both the **Self Aware Networks Theory of Mind** and **Super Information Theory**.

    NLP Transcripts & Source Links from 2017-2019 [NLP Transcripts & Source Links](https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks/blob/main/guide/NLP%20Transcripts%20from%202017-2019.pdf)

-   Across early episodes, you discuss:

    -   A **"transmission protocol of the brain"** and protocol analogies (TCP/UDP) as architectural primitives for interfacing with neural networks (conceptual seeds for SAN).

    -   **"Time slicing," differencing**, and **interference pattern** injection---sending *differences* rather than full sensory patterns (early precursors relevant to QGTCD's emphasis on temporal/phase structure and gradients).

    -   Positioning EEG/BCI + XR as a **bi‑directional interface**, with AI denoising/encoding to mirror and modulate internal states (SAN precursors).

### Nov 2, 2017 --- *The NerveGear Show* (public talk)

-   Public discussion on building **robot minds** with **self‑models**; a transcript line mentions starting a group called **"Self‑Waring Networks"** (clearly a transcription typo; later slides confirm **"Self‑Aware Networks"**). The same segment explicitly talks about **building self‑aware robots**, linking SAN to robotics.

### Aug 2, 2018 --- **Earliest verified public naming of "Self‑Aware Networks"**

-   **Neural Lace Podcast S2E1 (slides on YouTube)** shows:\
    **"Self‑Aware Networks"** group + **selfawarenetworks.com** on the title/slide, with context about **Neurohaxor**/Neurohackers and BCI/XR integrations---an explicit, public naming and URL for the project.

    NLP Transcripts from 2017-2019

    NLP Transcripts from 2017-2019

-   Technical content includes 3D point‑cloud neural networks, BCI + XR workflows, and real‑time ML pipelines (additional SAN "infrastructure" seeds).

    NLP Transcripts from 2017-2019

### Sep--Dec 2018 --- Additional conceptual scaffolding

-   Follow‑on Season 2 discussions sketch **volumetric/3D segmentation**, **visual‑neural correlations**, and the question of whether **self‑driving systems "need to become self‑aware networks"**---explicitly tying **self‑awareness** to system control models.

### 2017--2018 --- Medium pieces on AR/VR (under **micahsun** / **worksalt**)

-   Early writing focuses on AR/VR journalism and interviews; not yet using the SAN/QGTCD names directly, but aligned to the same BCI+XR research arc.

### May 15, 2022 --- Medium bio

-   A biographical overview on Medium; provides background but does not yet formalize the SAN/QGTCD labels.

### **June 17, 2022 --- First comprehensive public repository**

-   **GitHub: `v5ma/selfawarenetworks`** made public with drafts, disclaimers, and raw notes explicitly referencing **Self Aware Networks** and **Quantum Gradient Time Crystal Dilation**. The README and notes stress that many ideas go back to 2011 privately; June 17, 2022 is the earliest **public** consolidation. [GitHub](https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

    -   The README itself remarks: "*Note for the publication of the notes on June 17th 2022...*" and describes the repo as the **homepage of the Self Aware Networks Institute**; it links the **SAN** and **QGTCD** material and documents the project's scope. [GitHub](https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks)

### 2023 --- SVGN.io/Substack articles begin

-   You launch regular posts on **SVGN.io** (Substack), expanding on SAN, QGTCD, and related whitepapers/lectures. Examples include long‑form explanations that tie **oscillations, phase coding, and volumetric representation** to the SAN model. [svgn.io](https://www.svgn.io/p/a-new-book-out-today-bridging-molecular?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Oct 23, 2023 --- YouTube

-   **"Self Aware Networks: Theory of Mind"** video (public talk expanding SAN; references ongoing book notes).\
    *(Keep this entry if you want it in the README. If you'd like me to insert the direct link, share it or I can search again with a more specific title/URL.)*

### 2024 --- X/Twitter discourse + SVGN articles

-   By early **2024**, extended threads on X (under **@worksalt**) discuss **QGTCD** and compare it with other approaches; posts often reference the GitHub notes and SVGN articles.

-   Example SVGN article expanding SAN's biological backpropagation conjecture (and linking to repo content). [svgn.io](https://www.svgn.io/p/analog-biological-backpropagation?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 2024--2025 --- Ongoing activity, preprints, and talks

-   Continued YouTube/SVGN/X updates, demos, and long‑form posts on unifying relativity and quantum mechanics via **QGTCD**, plus the **SAN** theory of consciousness. See: book/long‑form posts (2024) and **Friston group** presentation write‑up (June 2, 2025). [svgn.io+1](https://www.svgn.io/p/a-new-book-out-today-bridging-molecular?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Notes & Disclaimers (updated)
-----------------------------

-   **Multiple handles / GitHub usernames**\

-   **Earlier public "seeds/roots" (2017--2018)**\
    Contrary to earlier summaries that placed the first public appearance in 2022, your transcripts show:

    -   **April--June 2017** Neural Lace Podcast monologue is explicitly described as containing **root concepts** for **Self Aware Networks** and **Super Information Theory**.

    -   **Aug 2, 2018** slides use **"Self‑Aware Networks"** by name and display **selfawarenetworks.com** (public naming).

    -   Conceptual **precursors to QGTCD** appear in 2017 discussions of **time slicing**, **interference**/**difference‑based injection**, and temporal/phase organization.

-   **SVGN.io pinned/summary pieces**\
    SVGN/Substack posts from 2023 onward expand on **SAN**, **QGTCD**, and related work, with references back to the GitHub repo and videos. [svgn.io](https://www.svgn.io/p/a-new-book-out-today-bridging-molecular?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

-   **Earliest verified named mentions (revised)**

    -   **Self Aware Networks (by name):** *Aug 2, 2018* (Neural Lace Podcast S2E1 slides).

    -   **Roots for SAN & Super Information Theory:** *April 2017* audio (explicitly noted in the transcript foreword).

    -   **Public consolidation of SAN + QGTCD notes:** *June 17, 2022* GitHub repo publication. [GitHub](https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

(Optional) "What changed" from your previous text
-------------------------------------------------

-   **Added 2017--2018 verifications** from your transcripts:

    -   **2017**: transcript front‑matter documents that the **April 2017** audio "contains the root concepts" for **SAN** and **Super Information Theory**.

    -   **2018**: first **public, on‑screen** use of **"Self‑Aware Networks"** and **selfawarenetworks.com** in **S2E1**.

-   **Kept 2022 GitHub** as the earliest **comprehensive** public release and the ongoing primary record. [GitHub](https://github.com/v5ma/selfawarenetworks?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

-   Preserved your **2023--2025** items (SVGN/Substack, YouTube, X) and added representative Substack citations where helpful. [svgn.io+2svgn.io+2](https://www.svgn.io/p/analog-biological-backpropagation?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
